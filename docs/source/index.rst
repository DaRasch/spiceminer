Welcome to the spiceminer documentation
***************************************

The spiceminer package is a high level python wrapper around
`NASAs CSPICE library <http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/>`_. It concentrates on
an easy to use API for analysing the data and doesn't include features to
change or create data. If you are looking for a more fully featured wrapper,
try these:

* `PySPICE <https://github.com/rca/PySPICE>`_
* `SpiceyPy <https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy>`_

`You can get the source code here <https://github.com/DaRasch/spiceminer>`_.
